## Project setup

### 1. Generate a new Vue3 project

```typescript
TODO
```

### 2. Vite

Vite is a new breed of frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) that updates your changes in the browser in as little as 16 milliseconds.
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

#### Config

> Vite is configured using a `vite.config.js` file in the root of your project. This file is written in CommonJS format and should export a plain JavaScript object.

```typescript
TODO
```

#### Plugins

> Vite supports a plugin system that allows you to customize the behavior of Vite itself and integrate with other tools. Plugins can be configured in the `vite.config.js` file.

```typescript
TODO
```

### 2. Package.json

> The package.json file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. npm can install the packages you specify in your package.json file.

#### Scripts

#### Dependencies vs Dev Dependencies

### 3. Tailwind CSS

> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It's completely customizable, completely extensible, and amazingly feature-rich.

```typescript
TODO
```

### 4. ESLint config

> ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:
    
```typescript
TODO
```

### 5. i18n

> i18n is a short name for internationalization. It is a process of designing and developing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.

```typescript
TODO
```

### 6. What the Typescript

> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open source.

```typescript
TODO
```
